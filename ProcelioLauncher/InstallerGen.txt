- Use Inno Setup to create launcher

WINDOWS
- The two elevated programs (download, update) are built from the same VS project with minor code modifications
--> Need the "run elevated" manifest that IDK how to do without VS.
- Build those progams and copy them into a Windows build of createImage
- AFTER building/copying them:
1) Make a zip of the files in jpckg/ProcelioLauncher (NOT the folder. All the files in it)
--> This is the "upload to server / standalone" build
2) Run Inno to generate the ProcelioLauncherInstaller.exe in WinInstaller

LINUX
